        This was an interesting exercise, I haven't been asked to do one like it
        before. It's hard not to think a nicer design won't be judged more
        positively, but I appreciated the assurance that design isn't the goal.
        More sample problems might have been nice, but otherwise I have no
        critiques. Side note: I started using the new app directory feature, but
        I built the project before reading the docs and decided to save time by
        not going back.
